# Morse Code Decoder
This project will decode an entire word in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. It uses:
-  A method that decodes a Morse code character, takes a string parameter, and return the corresponding character in uppercase (e.g. decode_char(".-") returns "A").
- A method that decodes an entire word in Morse code, takes a string parameter, and return the string representation. Every character in a word will be separated by a single space (e.g. decode_word("-- -.--") returns "MY").
